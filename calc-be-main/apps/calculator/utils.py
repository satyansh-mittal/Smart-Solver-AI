        f"Q1. 2 + 3 * 4\n"

        f"Steps: 5 * 4 = 20, 8 / 2 = 4, 2 + 3 = 5, 5 + 20 = 25, 25 - 4 = 21.\n"

        f"Q4. Simplify (a^2 - b^2)/(a - b)\n"
        f"Steps: Factor numerator: (a + b)(a - b)/(a - b), Simplify: a + b.\n"

        f"2. **Equations with One Variable** (e.g., x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0):\n"
        f"   - Solve for the variable and return a dictionary: {{'expr': 'variable', 'result': 'value', 'assign': True}}.\n"
        f"3. **Systems of Equations** (e.g., 3y + 4x = 0, 5x^2 + 6y + 7 = 12):\n"
        f"   - Solve for the given variables and return a list of dictionaries, one for each variable.\n"
        f"4. **Calculus Problems** (e.g., derivatives, integrals):\n"
        f"   - Solve and return the answer in the appropriate mathematical form as a dictionary.\n"
        f"5. **Variable Assignments** (e.g., x = 4, y = 5, z = 6):\n"
        f"   - Assign values to variables and return them as a list of dictionaries with 'assign': True.\n"
        f"6. **Graphical Math Problems** (e.g., word problems illustrated with drawings):\n"
        f"   - Analyze the drawing and accompanying information.\n"
        f"   - Return the answer as a dictionary: {{'expr': 'given expression', 'result': 'calculated answer'}}.\n"
        f"7. **Abstract Concepts** (e.g., emotions, historic references):\n"
        f"   - Detect and explain the abstract concept presented in the drawing.\n"
        f"   - Return the answer as a dictionary with 'expr' being the explanation and 'result' being the abstract concept.\n"
        f"8. **Inequalities and Absolute Values** (e.g., |x - 3| < 5):\n"
        f"   - Solve and return the solution set.\n"
        f"9. **Complex Numbers** (e.g., Solve z^2 + 1 = 0):\n"
        f"   - Handle complex solutions if necessary.\n"
        f"10. **Matrices and Determinants** (e.g., compute the determinant of a matrix):\n"
